## How to Use

To add the Zoomment commenting platform to your website, simply insert the following HTML code snippet into the HTML of the page where you want the comments to appear:

```html
<div
  id="zoomment"
  data-theme="light"
  data-language="en"
  data-emotions="❤️,😀,🪄,🥸,💡,🤔,💩,😢"
></div>
<script src="https://cdn.zoomment.com/zoomment.min.js"></script>
```

This snippet creates a dedicated space on your page for the Zoomment comments section and loads the necessary JavaScript to power the interaction.

## Configuration Options

Zoomment is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the commenting experience to fit your website’s theme and your audience's preferences. Here are the configuration options available through data attributes:

| Attribute Name | Possible values                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
